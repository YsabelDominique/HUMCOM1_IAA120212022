<h1 style="text-align: center;"> How to Apply Make-up</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">The power of makeup is undeniable; our favorite products help us create the beauty looks we love, enhance our favorite features, and encapsulate our individual definitions of beauty. The best makeup routines help the modern woman boost her confidence and face the world head on—no matter what the day has in store.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="1"> 
    <li style="font-weight: bold ;"> Step: MOISTURIZER</li>
    <dt>- Before you begin applying your makeup, take the time to prep your skin with a high-quality moisturizer. Choosing the right kind of moisturizer is a crucial piece of the puzzle</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Pour a small amount onto your fingers—the dollop should be roughly the size of a quarter. Start by spreading the moisturizer across your forehead; begin from the center of your face, then move outwards and up. Then, do the same starting at your nose, spreading the moisturizer across your cheeks.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: PRIMER</li>
    <dt>- Now that your skin is well moisturized, prep your face with primer. Whether you’re planning on applying a light coat of foundation or a full face of makeup, primer is an important first step. Using primer under your makeup will make your look last longer.</dt>
   <ul type="square">
       <li>Start with a dime-sized amount of primer in the center of your face, and slowly work it out towards your cheeks, forehead, and chin.</li>
   </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: LIQUID FOUNDATION</li>
    <dt>- Finding the perfect shade for your skin is priority number one. The right shade of foundation can make all the difference.</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Start from the center of your face and blend the liquid foundation outwards. As you sweep your foundation across the skin, be sure to buff it in</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: CONCEALER</li>
    <dt>- Two main categories of concealer: liquid and stick/compact.</dt>
    <ul>
        <li>Liquid concealer is best for the times you want light coverage over a large area of your face. </li>
        <li>Stick and compact concealers are well-suited for heavier coverage on smaller, more specific areas of the face.</li>
    </ul>
    <dd><i>To highlight your face using a liquid or cream concealer, place small dots in the following areas:</dd></i>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Horizontally over the center of your forehead</li>
            <li>Down the center of your nose</li>
            <li>your eyes</li> 
            <li>In a curving arch at the top of your chin, just under your bottom lip</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: FOUNDATION POWDER</li>
    <dt>- Applying foundation powder can be a tricky process; too little and you may as well have skipped the step altogether, too much and you’ll be sporting the dreaded “cake look”.</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Using a large, fluffy powder brush, begin by dusting a light coat of powder all over your face. Press the bristles into the powder, then sweep across the skin in long, arching strokes</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: BRONZER</li>
    <dt>- Bronzer can give your skin that sun-kissed glow all year long.</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Start at your forehead, pull the bronzer along your cheeks, then sweep it across the jawline, reaching all the way down to your chin.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: BLUSH</li>
    <dt>- Flushed cheeks have been a mainstay of makeup glamour for centuries. If you want to add a bit more color and vibrancy to your complexion, blush may be the key.</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>When using pink blush, apply it only to the apples of your cheeks</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: HIGHLIGHTER</li>
    <dt>- The right highlighter adds a bit of glam and glow to every makeup look. Whether you’re opting for a more natural look or want something bold and beautiful, highlighter can complement your makeup application.</dt>
    <dd><i>Where to put:</dd></i>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Down the bridge of your nose
        <li>Across the tops of your cheekbones</li>
        <li>In the inner corners of your eyelids</li>
        <li>On your brow bone</li>
        <li>The indent above your upper lip (also called the Cupid’s Bow)</li>
        <li>The center of your forehead</li>
        <li>The center of your chin</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: EYESHADOW</li>
    <dt>- Eyeshadow can add interest to your makeup look, whether you opt for neutral shades or go bold with colorful hues. Whichever look you use, grab two complementary eyeshadows: one lighter shade, and one darker shade.</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Dip your eyeshadow brush into the light shade, then tap the brush to get rid of any excess product. Apply the lighter shadow across the entire lid, starting at the lash line and ending just above the crease of your eyelid.
            Now dip your brush into the darker color, tapping off the excess once again. Apply the color at the outer corner of your eye, just above your lash line. Sweep the darker color across your eyelid crease, just under the brow bone.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: EYELINER</li>
    <dt>- Applying eyeliner can be difficult—one little mistake and you’re stuck with “raccoon” eyes. Banish your eye makeup woes with these essential tips for applying eyeliner.</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Liquid eyeliner, start thin at the inner corner of your eye, then make the application thicker towards the outer corner</li>
        <li>Gel eyeliner dip a flat, angular brush into the gel eyeliner pot. Swirl the brush to ensure both sides have product on them, and start application in the middle of the lash line, working outwards</li>
        <li>Sharpen your liner pencil each time you use it. After pulling your eyelid taut, draw small light dots starting at the outer corner of your upper eyelid.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: MASCARA</li>
    <dt>- If you’re going to use only one makeup product, mascara should be at the top of your list. A few swipes of mascara can make your eyes look brighter in a single step.</dt>
    <dd><i>How to put mascara:</dd></i>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Place the curler at the base of your upper lashes, being careful not to grab any of the sensitive skin around your eyelid</li>
            <li>Slowly close the curler</li>
            <li>Hold it in place for a few seconds</li>
            <li>Release gently</li>
        </ol>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: LIP GLOSS</li>
    <dt>- Before applying gloss, prep your lips. If your lips are chapped and cracked, be sure to use a gentle lip scrub to remove any dead skin and apply a protective lip gloss</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Begin applying your lip gloss from the center of your lips, and drag the applicator along the length of your pout</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step: SETTING SPRAY & SETTING POWDER</li>
    <dt>- Setting spray or setting powder can be the final touch for your makeup routine. If you want makeup that stays on all day long, without greasing, creasing, or shine, it’s important to invest in a quality setting solution.</dt>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Hold the bottle at least 8 inches from your face, then spritz lightly a few times to ensure all bits of your face are covered.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
