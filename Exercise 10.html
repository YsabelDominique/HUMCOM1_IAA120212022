<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<dl class="dl1">TWICE is undeniably one of the most popular K-pop groups in South Korea, if not the most popular girl group. Formed by MNET’s survival show SIXTEEN, TWICE got a lot of attention during their debut at the end of 2015. But they exploded in popularity a mere six months later when the instant hit “Cheer Up” skyrocketed them to the top – and they’ve been there ever since. As the representatives of bubblegum pop, TWICE has delivered classic after classic such as “TT,” “Likey,” “What is Love,” “Fancy,” and many more. With catchy songs, fun dance moves, and a team of stunningly gorgeous ladies, it’s no wonder TWICE is as beloved as they are.</dl>
<br>
<h3 class="h38">How was Twice formed</h3>
<p>
    Twice originated from a reality competition show. The 2015 series Sixteen involved that many JYP Entertainment “trainees”—the term used for aspiring idols preparing for a potential debut—fighting for a place in the group’s final lineup. After a series of challenges testing the contestants’ singing, rapping and dancing abilities as well as charisma, seven individuals were eliminated, with the remaining nine forming a new ensemble.
</p>
<h3 class="h36">Why Twice is the group name</h3>
<pr>
    How the group got the name "Twice", JYP Entertainment’s CEO Park Jin Young explained in a presscon: “It means that they will be able to move people twice. Once through the ears and once through the eyes.” 
</pr>
<h3 class="h37">Twice fanbase name</h3>
<p>
    Twice also has a name for its most dedicated fans—a feature shared by all K-pop acts (BTS’ fans are called “ARMYs,” Blackpink’s are “Blinks”). A follower of the girl group is a “Once.” The members explained the meaning on social media in 2015: “If you love us even once, we will repay your love with twice of our love.”
