                <h4>Star Cinema | ABS-CBN</h4>
                <p class="s1">
                The children of the Salazar family have been pursuing separate lives in the recent years. Teddie (Toni Gonzaga), the eldest, is working in Spain; Bobbie (Bea Alonzo), the second child, is working in New York; Alex (Angel Locsin), the third child is a Manila-based independent film assistant director; Gabbie (Shaina Magdayao) is a school teacher who lives at home; and CJ (Enchong Dee) works as an IT professional in Manila. After a few years of not being together as a whole family, they find themselves reuniting when CJ announces his plan to marry Princess, his girlfriend for three months.
                Much to their shock and dismay, CJ's sisters come together for the wedding and have agreed to dissuade him from marrying his fiancée. As they interact with each other, they also face the feelings and issues they've tried to hide. Teddie keeps the truth that she is far from the successful person her mom wants her to be; Bobbie struggles saying yes to her boyfriend's marriage proposal as she confronts the rift she had with her sister Alex; Alex becomes overly insecure and possessive of Chad, her long-term boyfriend, and Gabbie’s resentment about being left behind and being unappreciated by their mom also surfaces. CJ tries to juggle his responsibilities to his family and his future bride. All siblings re-examine how they were before, who they are now and face the ultimate test of their bond. This is a drama comedy of family relationships; of siblings who have grown together, apart and what it takes to make them grow together again; of love and forgiveness; and the acknowledgment of one's family.

                <h4>Panlasang Pinoy</h4>
                <p class="s2">
                The Filipino version of Carbonara, as featured in this recipe post, is different from traditional carbonara in terms of preparation and ingredients used. Filipino Carbonara is more of a pasta Alfredo with bacon. It is richer and creamier than the traditional version. This is attributed to the use of heavy cream. Italian carbonara, on the other hand, makes use of beaten eggs with Pecorino Romano cheese and lots of ground black pepper for the sauce.

                <p class="s3">
                Call of Duty, electronic game that brought new advances to the first-person shooter genre, winning numerous game of the year awards in 2003 and 2004 following its 2003 debut. Designed by the American company Infinity Ward and produced by Activision, Call of Duty used World War II as a setting, allowing players to see the war through the eyes of American, Soviet, and British soldiers. Call of Duty combined challenging single-player missions with a multiplayer engine that breathed new life into a genre spawned by such gaming greats as Doom and Quake.
