            Our wedding went off without a hitch and it’s in no small part because of their work. They are sticklers for attention to detail and they make sure your day goes according to plan.<br>
            They are worth every damn penny. Our wedding was in Baguio City and the Manor. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone. Top notch!”<br>

            “I could not speak higher of Sabby Angie Events. A week from our big day, we realized many plans were either unraveling, falling through the cracks, or simply not getting done. <br>
            Sabby Angie Events came in at the 11th hour to basically plan an entire wedding. Ysabel helped us make some key decisions, and once those decisions were made, the team just ran with it.<br>
            Took all the pressure off of us so we could enjoy the day. Sabby Angie Events, honestly went above and beyond to make sure our wedding was the best day ever…and they succeeded! So grateful to have had this team on our side. <br>
            Our wedding day would not have been what it was, without their support.”<br>
